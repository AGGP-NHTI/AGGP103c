Show the students how the 2D game kit is used. Show them how they can create portals and show them how to use the assets in the game kit. 
The students should be getting a good understanding by now what the 2D game kit is and how they can use this tool to help them in creating their own game. 
This week is the week where students can ask questions and ask for help from the professor.
